used to describe [[Oedipalized Disjunctive Synthesis]]

> When Oedipus slips into the disjunctive synthesis of desiring-recording, it imposes the ideal of a certain restrictive or exclusive use on them that becomes identical with the form of triangulation: being daddy, mommy, or child. This is the reign of the "either/or" in the [[differentiating]] function of the prohibition of incest: here is where mommy begins, there daddy, and there you are - stay in your place.
