%% TODO: talk about the text more precisely, and how the fallacy is applied to partial-global objects

> Here we have a properly analytical fallacy (which will be found again, to a considerable degree, in the theory of the signifier) that consists in passing from the detachable [[partial object]] to the position of a complete object as the thing detached ([[phallus]]). This passage implies a subject, defined as a fixed ego f one sex or the other, who necessarily experiences as a lack his subordination to the tyrannical complete object. 
> This is perhaps no longer the case when the partial object is posited for itself on the [[body without organs]], with - as its sole subject - not an "ego," but the drive that forms the desiring-machine along with it, and that enters into relationships of connection, disjunction, and conjunction with other partial objects, at the core of the corresponding multiplicity whose every element can only be defined _positively_.
