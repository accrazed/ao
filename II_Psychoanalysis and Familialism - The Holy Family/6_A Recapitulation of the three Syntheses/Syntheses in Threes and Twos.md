## [[Connective Synthesis]]
process of production, [[Libido]]
"and then... and then... and then..." (producer-products)
[[Coupures-prelevements]]
__use__: [[partial and nonspecific]]::[[global and specific]]
### [[Oedipalized Connective Synthesis]]
- Global/Specific use has two __aspects__:
	- __parental__: the triangular form of Oedipus
	- __conjugal__: the reproduction of this form
- Transcendent use of connective synthesis
- Paralogism of [[Extrapolation]] (Introducing Lack)
## [[Disjunctive Synthesis]]
method of  inscription, [[Numen]]
"either ...or... or... or... or..." (unbounded)
[[Coupures-detachements]](?)
__use__: [[affirmative, nonrestrictive, and inclusive]]::[[restrictive, exclusive, and negative]]
### [[Oedipalized Disjunctive Synthesis]]
- Restrictive use has two __poles__: 
	- the exclusive __symbolic__ differentiations
	- the undifferentiated __imaginary__
- Transcendent use of disjunctive synthesis
- Paralogism of the [[Double Bind]] 
## [[Conjunctive Synthesis]]
consumption-consummation, [[Voluptas]]
"so _that's_ what it is!" (wandering subject)
__moments__: [[nomadic and polyvocal]]::[[segregative and biunivocal]]
### [[Oedipalized Conjunctive Synthesis]]
- Biunivocal use has two __moments__:
	- a __racist, nationalistic, religious, etc__ moment that, via segregation, constitutes an __aggregate of departure__ presupposed by Oedipus
	- a __familial__ moment that constitutes the __aggregate of destination__ by means of an [[Application]]
- Paralogism of [[Application]]
