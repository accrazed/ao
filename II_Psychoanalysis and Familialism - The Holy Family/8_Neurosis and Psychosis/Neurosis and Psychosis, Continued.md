Oedipus is strictly undecidable ([[Undecidability]])

To this end, it's unfair then to try to maintain the groupings of neuroses and psychoses, because you can turn one into the other at whims, in order to fit to the narrative oedipus is trying to spin. This can be seen when trying to gauge "actual factors". 
## "Actual Factors"
 >There are not two groups, there is no difference in nature between neuroses and psychoses. _For in any case desiring-production is the cause_, the ultimate cause of both the psychotic subversions that shatter Oedipus or overwhelm it, and of the neurotic reverberations that constitute it. Such a principle takes on its full meaning if it is related to the problem of "actual factors"

Actual factors are seen as issues/problems/things suffering a patient today that, to psychoanalysis, must be related back to the complex in order to make sense of it, and "resolve" it. The problem is in figuring out when the patient is cured, and to do so psychoanalysts need to look to these less directly related "actual factors" to make shit up. 
### The **nature** of the factors
> were they somatic, social, metaphysical? Were they the famous "problems of living," through which a very pure desexualized idealism was reintroduced into psychoanalysis?
>>AO127:0
### The **modality** of the factors (privative)
> did they act in a negative, privative fashion, by mere frustration?
>>AO127:0
### The factor's **moment**, their own time (ulterior)
> was it not self-evident that the actual factors arose _afterward_, and signified "recent," in opposition to the infantile or the oldest factor that could be sufficiently explained by the familial complex?
>>AO127:0

In establishing that an actual deprivation can't be experienced except with respect to an older time that was the "cause" of those factors, it not only shuts out any non-real roads but also all other possible real roads that don't lead to Oedipus (the double-impasse).

> The following choice is imposed on us: either the actual factor is conceived in a totally exterior privative fashion (privative) (which is an impossibility), or it descends into an internal qualitative conflict that is necessarily understood in relation to Oedipus (ulterior). (Oedipus, the fountainhead where the psychoanalyst washes his hands of the world's iniquities.)
