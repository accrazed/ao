Neurosis and Psychosis are (questionably) laid at ends, with an inverse relationship to the Object function of reality (The Imaginary), and the causal complex (Symbolic)
## Freudian Neurosis
In Neurosis, reality is preserved (Oedipus still presents itself "correctly" on the subject's imaginary), and the causal complex is repressed. However sometimes neurosis ruptures in the "return of the repressed", like in obsessional cancellation.

In _Inhibition, Symptoms and Anxiety_, Freud writes:
>In obsessional neurosis the technique of undoing what has been done is first met with in the ‘diphasic’ symptoms, in which one action is cancelled out by a second, so that it is as though neither action had taken place, whereas, in reality, both have.

The repression here is in imagining that nothing has taken place.
## Freudian Psychosis
In Psychosis, the causal complex "invades" the real, becoming object (the "Undifferentiated" Imaginary), and the real reality (reality itself) has to be repressed by this burden. However sometimes psychosis regains reality alongside delirious reconstruction.
## The Convergence
>And it seems important that, following an original path, Freud encounters again an idea dear to traditional psychiatry: that madness is fundamentally linked to a loss of reality. Thus there is a convergence with the psychiatric elaboration of the notions of dissociation and autism.

The problem with this structure between psychosis and neurosis is in how much the oedipal complex is effectively irrelevant: when the person is neurotic/"fixed", we can't see oedipus, but oedipus says its just because its repressed; but when the person is psychotic/as least real as possible, apparently _now_ is when the family appears commonly, and they're described only compared to the complex, which is forced on the psychotic as extra noise.

>But isn't it true that, in psychosis, the familial complex appears precisely as a stimulus whose quality is a matter of indifference, a simple inductor not playing the role of organizer, where the intensive investments of reality bear on something totally different (the social, historical, and cultural fields)?
