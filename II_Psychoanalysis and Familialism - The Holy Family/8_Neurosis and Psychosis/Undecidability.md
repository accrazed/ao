>We now come to the realization that the simple opposition between the two groups is inadequate, an opposition that would allow one to define neurosis as an intra-oedipal disorder, and psychosis as an extra-oedipal escape. It is not even enough to state that the two groups are "capable of being joined." Rather it is the possibility of discrimination directly between the two that creates the difficulty. How can we distinguish between the pressure that familial reproduction exercises on desiring-production, and the pressure that desiring-production exercises on familial reproduction? The Oedipal triangle vibrates and trembles, but is this in terms of the hold over the machines of desire that it constantly guarantees itself, or in terms of these machines that escape the Oedipal imprint and cause the triangle to release its grip? Where does the resonance of the triangle reach its limit? A familial romance expresses an effort to save the Oedipal genealogy, but it also expresses a free thrust of non-oedipal genealogy. Fantasies are never pregnant forms, but border or frontier phenomena ready to cross over to one side or the other. In short, _Oedipus is strictly undecidable._ It can be found everywhere all the more readily for being undecidable, and in this sense it is correct to say that Oedipus is strictly good for nothing.
