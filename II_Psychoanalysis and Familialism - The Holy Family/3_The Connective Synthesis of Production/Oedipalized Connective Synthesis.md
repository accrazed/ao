Instead of viewing machines as [[partial and nonspecific]], they are viewed as [[global and specific]]. In effect, [desiring production of infinite parts::un-unifying whole] are replaced with the production of [idealistic wholes::global/all-encompassing truths::complete objects].

The [[partial and nonspecific]] use of desiring machines further breaks into two __aspects__:
- The parental aspect: the triangular form of Oedipus
- The conjugal aspect: the reproduction of the Oedipal form

This use is based on certain [[Paralogisms of psychoanalysis]]: namely the "extraction of a transcendent complete object from the [[signifying chain]]". This in turns makes the entire chain seem dependent on the object, defined with an element of [[Lack]], and fuses desire with [[Phallus]].

All desiring production that falls outside the complete objects become a problem to be cured. See [[Oedipalized Disjunctive Synthesis]]
