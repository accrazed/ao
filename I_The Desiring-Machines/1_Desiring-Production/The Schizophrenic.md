### [[Celibate Machine]]
The schizophrenic can sometimes experience intensive quantities in their pure state, without it necessarily transforming into a return of the repressed -> [[Celibate Machine]] (?)

> There is a schizophrenic experience of intensive quantities in their pure state, to a point that is almost unbearable -- a celibate misery and glory experienced to the fullest, like a cry suspended between life and death, an intense feeling of transition states of pure, naked intensity stripped of all shape and form.

These intense quantities are first and foremost experienced as a primary [emotion::feeling], which is then followed by [delirium::"I think"] and [hallucination::"I hear"::"I see"]. This [emotion::feeling] internalizes [delirium::"I think"] and externalizes [hallucination::"I hear"::"I see"]
