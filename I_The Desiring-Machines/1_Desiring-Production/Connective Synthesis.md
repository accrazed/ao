Also known as the _production of production_, or _coupling_, the connective synthesis is a rule that defines the production of production, i.e. the [[Desiring Machines]]

See [[Desiring Machines#Formal Definition]] for a formal definition on the rules that define the law of [[Connective Synthesis]] 

The connective "labor"/energy in this process is described as [[Libido]] 

When the productive connections pass from machines to the [[Body Without Organs]], then another law is imposed on those connections - that of [[Disjunctive Synthesis]]. A part of the energy of [[Libido]] turns into [[Numen]]
