## Formal Definition
[[Desiring Machines]] are a subset of [[Machine]]s: BINARY machines

They follow a set of rules (the [[Connective Synthesis]]) that determines their associations: one machine is always coupled with another. There is always a flow-producing machine that interrupts some machine and is interrupted by another machine. This flow, this "energy", is described as [[Libido]] and becomes related/partially transformed to [[Numen]] and [[Voluptas]] later.

The [ordered set of binary-ruled machines::binary series] of a desiring machine chain is all linear, and in all directions (by the way they have direction too lol).

> Desire constantly couples continuous flows and partial objects that are by nature fragmentary and fragmented

## Other
An "Object" presupposes a continuity of a flow, which in of itself presupposes the fragmentation the "Object"

Partial objects are everywhere, the Schizophrenic object
