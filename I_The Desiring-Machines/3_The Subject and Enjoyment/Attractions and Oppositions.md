[[Desiring Machines]] > [CONTRAST]::[OPPOSITION]::[REPULSION] < [[Body Without Organs]], as found in the [[Paranoiac Machine]] of primary repression, creates space for an attraction in the [[Miraculating Machine]]. Attraction and Repulsion persist in opposition, which can only be reconciled with a new machine that functions as a "return of the repressed": The [[Celibate Machine]].

>ex. [[Robert Gie]], the very talented designer of paranoiac electrical machines: "Since he was unable to free himself of these currents that were tormenting him, he gives every appearance of having finally joined forces with them, taking passionate pride in portraying them in their total victory, in their triumph."

> Ex Schreber's Illness (As specified by [[Freud]]): He stresses the crucial turning point that occurs in Schreber's Illness when Schreber becomes reconciled to becoming-woman and embarks upon a process of self-cure that brings him back to the equation Nature = Production (the production of a new humanity)
> "I am sometimes to be found, standing before the mirror or elsewhere, with the upper portion of my body partly bared, and wearing sundry feminine adornments, such as ribbons, trumpery necklaces, and the like. This occurs only, may I add, when I am *by myself*, and never, at least so far as I am able to avoid it, in the presence of other people." 

This [[Celibate Machine]] forms an alliance between the [[Desiring Machines]] and the [[Body Without Organs]] and produces a new humanity. 

- [[The Subject]] is merely residue alongside the [[Desiring Machines]]
- [[The Subject]] confuses itself with the [[Celibate Machine]]:+:[CM's residual reconciliation]->
- [[The Subject]] confuses itself with the [[Conjunctive Synthesis]] of consummation in the form of a wonderstruck "So *that's* what it was!" 

Create, starting from zero, a series of states in the [[Celibate Machine]]; and the subject is born of each state in the series, is continually reborn of the following state that determines him at a given moment, consuming-consummating all these states that cause him to be born and reborn (the lived state coming first, in relation to the subject that lives it)

The state of zero intensity is [[autism]]
