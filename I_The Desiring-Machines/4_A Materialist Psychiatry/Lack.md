Describing desire in terms of [[Lack]] is a relatively easy common-sense to engage in and acts as coordinated [[disjunctions]] for anti-production. This allows anti-production (and the [[Body Without Organs]]) to fall back on production and appropriate it, [[miraculate]] it (just like capital does with the modes of production).

> Lack (_manque_\*) is created, planned, and organized in and through social production ([[Technical Machines]]). It is counterproduced as a result of the pressure of antiproduction; the latter falls back on (_se rabat sur_)the forces of production and appropriates them. [...] The deliberate creation of lack as a function of market economy is the art of a dominant class. This involves deliberately organizing wants and needs (_manque_) amid an abundance of production; making all of desire teeter and fall victim to the great fear of not having one's needs satisfied; and making the objects dependent upon a real production that is supposedly exterior to desire (the demands of rationality) while at the same time the production of desire is categorized as fantasy and nothing but fantasy.

[[Social Production]] in this form now values itself above desiring-production, also spawning the false dichotomy of [[Individual Fantasy]] to [[Group Fantasy]]
