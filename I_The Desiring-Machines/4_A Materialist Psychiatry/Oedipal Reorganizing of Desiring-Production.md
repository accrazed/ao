Firstly, there are many attempts in the oedipal fields of psychoanalysis to explain their systems in a materialist way, i.e. a *Materialist Psychiatry*. However, these materialisms usually tend to be flawed, and ultimately become false coverings of an idealist psychiatry.

Psychoanalysis formulates schizophrenia into a trinary schema Dissociation, Autism, and Being-in-the-world

This schema however relies on an abstracted "body-image"/"final avatar of the soul" in order to relate schizophrenia to ego, and satisfy spiritual/positivist requirements:
#### Dissociation (Kraepelin)
> an explanatory concept that supposedly **locates** the specific dysfunction or primary deficiency
> >AO22:1

The schizophrenic, [scoped::scalped] as a dissociated ego.
#### Autism (Bleuler)
> An ideational concept indicating the specific nature of the **effect** of the disorder: the delirium itself or the complete withdrawal from the outside world, "the detachment from reality, accompanied by a relative or an absolute predominance of [the schizophrenic's] inner life." 
> > AO22:1

The schizophrenic, [scoped::scalped] as an ego cut off from the world.
#### Being-in-the-world (Binswanger)
> A descriptive one, discovering or rediscovering the delirious person in his own specific world.
> > AO22:1

The schizophrenic, [scoped::scalped] as an ego that had not ceased to be, who was there in the most specific way, but in his very own world, though he might reveal himself to a phenomenologist .

> The fact is, from the moment that we are placed within the framework of Oedipus - from the moment that we are measured in terms of Oedipus - the cards are stacked against us, and the only real relationship, that of production, has been done away with.

The point of emphasis is that this oedipal structuring necessarily limits the real schizophrenic nature (*homo natura*)

This system is [[global and specific]], [pausing::teleogizing(the thing as a goal-in-itself)::void-infinitizing] the schizophrenic process in order to describe it in accordance to idealistic [causations::comprehensions::expressions]

To contrast, the material process of production completely dissolves any semblance of specificity, instead being [[partial and nonspecific]]
