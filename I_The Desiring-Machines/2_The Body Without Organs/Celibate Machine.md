> Attraction and Repulsion persist in opposition, which can only be reconciled with a new machine that functions as a "return of the repressed": The [[Celibate Machine]].

The [[Celibate Machine]] produces [[intensive quantities]]
By the [[Celibate Machine]]'s means, intensive quantities are produced

>  There is a schizophrenic experience of intensive quantities in their pure state, to a point that is almost unbearable -- a celibate misery and glory experienced to the fullest, like a cry suspended between life and death, an intense feeling of transition states of pure, naked intensity stripped of all shape and form.

## Where do the intensive quantities come from?
They're at the very least produced by [[Celibate Machine]]s, but they come from the two preceding forces, [[Attractions and Repulsions]], and from the opposition of these two forces

When put together, [[Attractions and Repulsions]] DO NOT return to zero intensity. zero intensity designates the [[Body Without Organs]]. Their opposition is [greater than::positive to] zero intensity, and fluctuate in relative amplitudes of [[Attractions and Repulsions]]. ex.
## Examples
- [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s painting _La mariée mise_ à _nu par ses célibataires_, _même_ ([[The Bride Stripper Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]])
- The Machine in [[Kafka]]'s [[In the Penal Colony]]
- [[Raymond Roussel]]s machines
- Some of [[Edgar Allen Poe]]'s Machines (may be the [[The Masque of the Red Death]])
- [[Alfred Jarry]]'s [[Supermale]]
- [[Villier]]'s _Eve Future_ [[The Future Eve]]

All these examples are linked together via the [[Desiring Machines]] transformation into a [[Paranoiac Machine]], countered via a [[Miraculating Machine]], and resolving through the [[Celibate Machine]]

> The celibate machine first of all reveals the existence of a much older paranoiac machine, with its tortures, its dark shadows, its ancient Law. The celibate machine itself is not a paranoiac machine, however. Everything about it is different: its cogs, its sliding carriage, its shears, needles, magnets, rays. Even when it tortures or kills, it manifests something new and different, a solar force. In the second place, this transfiguration cannot be explained by the "Miraculating" powers the machine possesses due to the inscription hidden inside it, though it in fact contains within itself the most impressive sort of inscriptions. A genuine consummation is achieved by the new machine, a pleasure that can rightly be called autoerotic, or rather automatic: the nuptial celebration of a new alliance, a new birth, a radiant ecstasy, as though the eroticism of the machine liberated other unlimited forces.
