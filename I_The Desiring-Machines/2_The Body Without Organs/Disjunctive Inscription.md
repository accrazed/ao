>Thus the schizophrenic, the possessor of the most touchingly meager capital [...] inscribes on his body the litany of disjunctions, and creates for himself a world of parries where the most minute of permutations is supposed to be a response to the new situation or a reply to the indiscreet questioner. The disjunctive synthesis of recording therefore **comes to overlap the connective synthesis of production. The process as process of production extends into the method as method of inscription.** Or rather, if what we term libido is the connective "labor" of desiring-production, is should be said that a part of this energy is transformed into the energy of disjunctive inscription (Numen)

It's energy flows as [[Numen]]
