>In fact, we have passed imperceptibly into a domain of the production of recording, whose law is not the same as that of the production of production. The law governing the latter was [[connective synthesis]] or coupling. But when the productive connections pass from machines to the body without organs (as from labor to capital), it would seem that they then come under another law that expresses a distribution in relation to the nonproductive element as a "natural or divine presupposition" (the disjunctions of capital). Machines attach themselves to the body without organs as so many points of disjunction, between which an entire network of new syntheses is now woven, marking the surface off into co-ordinates, like a grid

In the structuralization (coordination) of reality, described via the phrase "Either ... or ... or ... or ..."

In relation to the [[Miraculating Machine]], [[Disjunctive Synthesis]] relates to the rules that machines undergo upon their being appropriated from "pure" desiring production ([[Connective Synthesis]]) onto the [[Body Without Organs]]

> The body without organs [...] serves as a surface for the recording of the entire process of production of desire, so that desiring-machines seem to emanate from it in the apparent objective movement that **establishes a relationship between the machines and the body without organs**
