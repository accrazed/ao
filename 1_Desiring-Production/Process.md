> What the schizophrenic experiences, both as an individual and as a member of the human species, is not at all any one specific aspect of nature, but ***nature as a [[process of production]]***.

There are several important meanings to understand for the word [[process]] here. All of them all the time :thumbs_up:
## 1. Process, Recording, and Consumption
[[Process]] incorporates [[recording]] and [[consumption]] within production itself, making the [[process of production]] include all.

That is, Production immediately determines [[consumption]] and [[recording]], and these in turn directly reproduce.

## 2. NATURE and MAN
NATURE is no different from MAN. They are one and the same essential reality, the [[producer-product]]. MAN only fucks around with the machines and plugs shit into each other.

> Man as the being who is in intimate contact with the profound life of all forms or all types of beings, who is responsible for even the stars and animal life, and who ceaselessly plugs an organ-machine into an energy-machine, a try into his body, a breast into his mouth, the sun into his asshole

> Production as process overtakes *all* idealistic categories and constitutes a cycle whose relationship to desire is that of an immanent principle
> >AO5::0
## 3. Production as process
[[Process]] is NOT a goal in of itself
[[Process]] is NOT an infinite perpetuation of itself

[END PROCESS] :: [STOP IT ABRUPTLY AND PREMATURELY]
[PROLONG PROCESS INDEFINITELY] :: [STOP IT ABRUPTLY AND PREMATURELY]

[[Process]] is completed at some point. Something gets produced.
