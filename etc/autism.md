the state of zero intensity between [[attractions and oppositions]] upon the [[Body Without Organs]]

>Thus the schizo would not be ill within the Oedipus complex, from an Oedipus arising all the more in his hallucinated consciousness as he lacked it in the symbolic organization of "his" unconscious. 
>
>On the contrary, he is ill _because_ of the oedipalization to which he is made to submit—the most somber organization—and which he can no longer tolerate: he who has gone on a distant journey. As though one were constantly bringing back home the person capable of settings whole continents and cultures adrift. He is not suffering from a divided self or a shattered Oedipus, but on the contrary, from having been brought back to everything he had left.

> A drop in intensity to the body without organs = 0, [[autism]]: the schizo has no other means of reacting to this blocking of all his investments of reality, the barriers of repression placed before him by the Oedipal system of social and psychic repression. As Laing says, they are interrupted in their journey. They have lost reality But when did they lose it? During the journey, or during the interruption of the journey?
