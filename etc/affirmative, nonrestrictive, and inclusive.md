> It becomes nevertheless apparent that schizophrenia teaches us a singular extra-Oedipal lesson, and reveals to us an unknown force of the disjunctive synthesis, an immanent use that would no longer be exclusive or restrictive, but fully [[affirmative, nonrestrictive, and inclusive]]. A disjunction that remains disjunctive, and that still affirms the disjoined terms, that affirms them throughout their entire distance, _without restricting one by the other or excluding the other from the one_, is perhaps the greatest paradox. "Either...or...or" instead of "either/or"

> The schizophrenic is dead _or_ alive, not both at once, but each of the two as the [[terminal point]] of a distance over which he glides. He is child _or_ parent, not both, but the one at the end of the other, like the two ends fo a stick in a nondecomposable space.
