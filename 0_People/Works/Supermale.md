[[Alfred Jarry]]'s last book.

> The novel, Jarry's last, revolves around a race between a train and a team of cyclists fuelled by [perpetual-motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual-motion "Perpetual-motion") food and the exploits of a "supermale" capable of prodigious feats of endurance and sexual athleticism. _Supermale_ was translated into English by [Barbara Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Wright_(translator) "Barbara Wright (translator)") in 1968.

In this case, the Supermale, _Andre Marcueil_, is the [[Celibate Machine]]. 

> Andre Marcueil - The "Supermale" of the novel, whose exploits are described in third-person narration. At first, Andre seems to be a misunderstood, psychologically-scarred man with supernatural abilities. However, after the death of the girl on the Lurance estate he is revealed as callous and inhuman. Throughout the novel, Andre seeks to push human boundaries.

> The Indian - Andre's alter ego, a quiet, handsome, athletic-looking man. When Andre sets out to break the record, he disguises himself as an Indian (complete with tomahawk and makeup).

In this case, Andre is in an extreme state of opposition/transformation between himself and the Indian. Andre is in this case the [[Agent of Persecution]]/[[Paranoiac Machine]].

>During a dinner party at the mansion of Andre Marcueil, the main character, several guests discuss the nature of love. Arthur Gough, William Elson, Dr. Bathybius, and the host propose four definitions of love. Love is thought to be an emotion; an impression on the soul, an enfeebled sensation, **and (which Andre tries to prove) an activity**.

> The story then flashes back to Andre’s childhood, introducing the idea of the Supermale. Andre, a sexually-repressed 12-year-old, is confused about his body. He begins taking [bromide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromide#Medical_uses "Bromide") and exercising to become super-strong.

Here is Andre, the [[Agent of Persecution]], asserting that love is an activity, and then further goes to prove it by both cutting down the roses that his love interest, Ellen, finds admirable ("love is activity, not an enfeebled sensation"). He and Ellen love by just having a lot of sex, and that's pretty much it. He also rapes and kills a girl by trying to have sex with her so much and she ends up dying as a result. The matter is taken lightly -> to the [[Agent of Persecution]], apparently they didn't love each other enough.

The Indian, however, is the [[Miraculating Machine]], the Agent of Attraction. He breaks the sex record with Ellen, and is generally seen as fantastic/godly, capable of solving their problems.

> The Indian is carried to where the people are, and they speculate that he can revive them by producing offspring with supreme qualities. However, the Indian says that he is sterile (much to their dismay). He returns to the room where Ellen is sleeping.

Another point of note is the _Love Machine_ mentioned in the story, which serves as the medium in which Andre and the Indian reconcile into the [[Celibate Machine]], which must love Ellen.

> Andre is revealed as the Indian, and William Elson is convinced that Andre must love Ellen. It is agreed that a love machine (similar to an electric chair) must be built to force Andre to love Ellen. While Andre is still faint from the sex marathon, he is strapped to the love machine. He awakens when 11,000 volts are sent through his body, causing him to break free of his chair and try to escape, but he dies. Over time, Ellen eventually gets over Andre, and marries a man who can keep his love within human capacities.

Turns out his state of intense transformation was too intense for his moral coils, though for a moment he was entirely autoerotic/automatic, truly "loving".
