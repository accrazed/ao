> **Gregory Bateson** (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English [anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), [social scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences "Social sciences"), [linguist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), [visual anthropologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_anthropology "Visual anthropology"), [semiotician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics"), and [cyberneticist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics") whose work intersected that of many other fields. His writings include _[Steps to an Ecology of Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_to_an_Ecology_of_Mind "Steps to an Ecology of Mind")_ (1972) and _Mind and Nature_ (1979).
> In [Palo Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto "Palo Alto"), California, Bateson and in these days his non-colleagues(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Bateson#cite_note-1) developed the [double-bind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind "Double bind") theory of [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia "Schizophrenia").
> Bateson's interest in [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory") forms a thread running through his work. He was one of the original members of the core group of the [Macy conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences "Macy conferences") in Cybernetics (1941–1960), and the later set on Group Processes (1954–1960), where he represented the social and behavioral sciences. He was interested in the relationship of these fields to [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology"). His association with the editor and author [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand "Stewart Brand") helped widen his influence.

Meh, not much else besides this [[Oedipalized Disjunctive Synthesis#The Double Bind]] that seems particularly interesting of his. Would have to really dig into his stuff.
